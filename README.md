## Notes

Please keep in mind that I did not complete HW3 due to personal circumstances and life problems. The CSS for my site is still very incomplete, but it is a slight improvement from nothing! I have some additional notes for this assignment. They will be listed below

### DOMPurify

When I deployed the site, I had some issues getting DOMPurify to work from the node_modules folder. I eventually got it to work using a CDN import link, so I commented out the other script tag.

### Custom Dialogs

When approaching the custom dialogs, I initially put templates for each dialog in my html file and I found that this worked fine. I would have liked to do this part in JS but I did not have enough time and my stuff works anyway so I figure it is no big deal
